# Future Scope
  ‚û°Ô∏è Implementing a robust user verification process (such as ID verification or social media login) will help build trust between buyers and sellers, reducing fraud and fake listings. <br><br>
  ‚û°Ô∏è Developing an Android and iOS mobile app can increase user engagement and convenience, especially for young users who prefer mobile platforms. <br><br>
  ‚û°Ô∏è Currently using basic demo payment methods, the platform can later integrate with trusted gateways like Razorpay, Paytm, Stripe, or PayPal for enhanced security and reliability. <br><br>
  ‚û°Ô∏è Adding a buyer-seller chat feature would allow direct communication to clarify product conditions, negotiate prices, or finalize deals. <br><br>
  ‚û°Ô∏è An admin panel with data analytics (e.g., number of sales, most resold shoes, top users) can help manage and optimize the platform efficiently. <br><br>
  ‚û°Ô∏è Users have the flexibility to add multiple addresses while placing an order on our website. This allows them to choose or manage different delivery locations as per their convenience. <br><br>
